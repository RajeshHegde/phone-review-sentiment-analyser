My moto e again become the best one. I had not face restart problem since last 48 hours :) .... I just turn off battery saver and remove my g mail account for atleast 24 hours . and then i add another gmail account. And now its rocking........

I suggest to do the same to those who are facing the automatic restart problem.....

And i must say that this device is much much batter then other mobile in this range. Not on feature basis but on brand name. And also providing a very good after service. You can chat with motorola cc from 9 pm to 9 am .And they are doing their best to help the customers. At this price a multinational brand like GOOGLE provide you such a great product and service ..... Its amazing.....



Go for ..... Moto e .......

Rest choice is yours......

Those who are talking about redme 1s and micromax.. let me tell u guys that redme 1s have so many issues regarding heating.. and micromax.. huh ! u will face camera problems and battery drainage problem.. and moto E is a google phone, which is a best brand overall. I will prefer moto E .. :)

if u want a better battery life then go for this mobile its do not have a closer competition in this segment .

only one cons for this mobile that is = the camera was pathetic for this phone .
if u want a pure android experience without camera then its a best in class phone.
(or if u want a better camera but ready to sacrifice on battery then go for any android one device)

Really not good phone..dont have front camera...also battery is 1980 Lithium -Ion ...also in this same price , go beyond lenovo,micromax please..
